Employee Manager app using Java, Spring Boot, Angular, HTML, CSS

a web app to test full stack knowledge (or to gain it :]) 

	1) First things first, we use spring initialzr to generate our project and add dependencies
	2) We create a new package (directory) to separate the models from the "main" app
	3) First we create employee, which is the same old thing you know by now
